# Project 01: Write a program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not. 

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input number: 55</p>
<h3>Ontput</h3>

Number is divisible by 5 and 11

# Project 02: Write a program to check whether a year is leap year or not. 

```bash
if (year%400 ==0){
// leap year
}
elase if (year%4==0 && year%100!=0){
// leap year
}else {
//
}
```

<h2>Example</h2>
<h3>Input</h3>

Input year: 2004
<h3>Output</h3>

2004 is leap year.</br>

Step by step descriptive logic to check
leap year.</br>
• Input year from user. Store it in some
variable say year.</br>
• If year is exactly divisible by 4 and not
divisible by 100, then it is leap year.
Or if year is exactly divisible by 400
then it is leap year.




# Project 03: Write a program to input weeknumber and output the weekday.
<h2>Example</h2>
<h3>Input</h3>
Input week number: 1
<h3>Output</h3>

Sunday


# Project 04: Write a program to input marks of five subjects Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics and Computer. Calculate percentage and grade according to following:

Percentage >= 90% : Grade A </br>
Percentage >= 80% : Grade B </br>
Percentage >= 70% : Grade C  </br>
Percentage >= 60% : Grade D </br>
Percentage >= 40% : Grade E </br>
Percentage < 40% : Grade F </br>

<h2>Example</h2>
<h3>Input</h3>

Input marks of five subjects:</br>
95, 95, 97, 98, 90
<h3>Output</h3>


Percentage = 95.00 </br>
Grade A 
</br>
In primary mathematics classes
you have learned about
percentage. Just to give a quick
recap, below is the formula to
calculate percentage:</br>
percetage = (phy + chem + bio +
math + comp) / 5.0;

# Project 05: Write a program to input electricity unit charges and calculate total electricity bill according to the given condition:

For first 50 units BDT 0.50/unit </br>
For next 100 units BDT 0.75/unit </br>
For next 100 units BDT 1.20/unit </br>
For unit above 250 BDT 1.50/unit </br></br>
An additional surcharge of 20% is added to the
bill.

<h2>Example</h2>
<h3>Input:</h3>

Enter total units consumed: 150
<h3>Output:</h3>
Electricity Bill = BDT 120.00
