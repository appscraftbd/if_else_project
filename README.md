# Project 01: Write a program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not. 

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input number: 55</p>
<h3>Ontput</h3>

Number is divisible by 5 and 11

# Project 02: Write a program to check whether a year is leap year or not. 

```bash
if (year%400 ==0){
// leap year
}
elase if (year%4==0 && year%100!=0){
// leap year
}else {
//
}
```

<h2>Example</h2>
<h3>Input</h3>

Input year: 2004
<h3>Output</h3>

2004 is leap year.</br>

Step by step descriptive logic to check
leap year.</br>
• Input year from user. Store it in some
variable say year.</br>
• If year is exactly divisible by 4 and not
divisible by 100, then it is leap year.
Or if year is exactly divisible by 400
then it is leap year.
